PART 2 2/2:

34: The defirence is that an arraylist is a list of items in order,
based on an index system. Meanwhile, the HashMap is a scrambled system
where every value is identified with a key, or ID, that can be type
int, string, double, ect, unlike an arraylist. However, one thing that
is similar between the two is the fact that they both are meant to store
more than one value in a sort of bank where they can be retreived.

35: Returning a result in the arraylist is randomized, while it isin't
in the hashmap.

36: There isin't any problem.



PART 3:

43: putIfAbsent inserts only when the key's value is not there in the map.

46: 

- Accurate? Generally yes, if Javadoc comments are properly written.
- Complete? Only if all classes and methods are documented.
- Useful parts: Class summaries, method signatures, parameter descriptions.
- Not useful: Auto-generated sections without comments.
- Errors? Missing or incorrect tags, undocumented methods, or poor formatting.
